# glyph-game

## description of project 

Our planned project is to have a Glyph game, which is a fun visual twist on wordle. The user will first be shown a single abstract shape comprised of 4-7 letters. They must then must guess the correct letters included in the shape, and then rearrange the letters to match the secret correct word. 

## 3 functions

get_word() : retrieve either a 4, 5, 6, or 7 letter word from a word bank that we will create in a JSON file

initialize_game() : create the grid/board, set starting score/number of correct letters guessed

get_response() : this function will assess the user's input and decide whether to return "correct", and keep a letter in the display, or "incorrect" if the letter is not correct, and don't keep the letter


## task delegation

Pihu's job: Write the return code (get_response()) and figure out code logic for keeping score of correct letters and ending the game when score meets the threshold

Liv's job: Figure out the proper code for setting up the graphics, write the get_word() code after creating json file with Pihu of random words

## updated changes: 
Material we will provide to users is all the letters of the alphabet as submission options as well as the amount of letters that are in the glyph
The logic of our program is that we have letters that all fit within a certain boundary to form a combined symbol. The user will enter a letter, and the computer will then assess if that response is identical to one of the letters in the randomly chosen word and keep it to show the user that while the rest of the word may be incorrect, a single letter is correct.
Someone would use this program for enjoyment or to continually train their brain 
Datafile would be a python file with imported json file (collection of words) and imported text file (instructions) 
To test the entire functionality of the program, the user would purposely test words that they know have one letter correct to make sure that the computer recognizes single letters and also recognizes those that are incorrect
